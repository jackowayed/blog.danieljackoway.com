title: The Next Columbine Will Be Gay
---

On Wednesday I went to a vigil for the recent suicides of queer (I mean it as an umbrella term for "not straight", not anything derrogatory) adolescents that have recently committed suicide. It was really depressing; students talked about their struggles, read states, and recited poetry. The message I took away from it was that, sadly, being gay in America sucks.

First, some of the stats. None of these are new developments, but it is a pretty new thing that people are actually paying attention to them:

* LGBT children are almost 4 times more likely to commit suicide.
* 2 of 5 LGBT children think about suicide often
* 3 of 5 LGBT children feel unsafe at school
* Only 16 states (plus DC) have laws that protect students against bullying based on sexual orientation

But one thing that really stuck out to me was when they read a couple of the suicide notes. I'll list some quotes from [one of them](http://www.suicide.org/suicide-note-of-a-gay-teen.html) Note that there's a lot of typos and poor punctuation. Everything is sic:

    So I am gay. Why dooes everyone hate me becaus of that. Fuck them. I have been punched and spit on andcalled faggot, queer, loser, pussy, fag boy.

    I hve receved hate letters telling me to leave school telling me that faggots aren't welcome

    They should all be in prison.they are horrible I hate eveyht fucking one so fuck ethem.

    [name removed] started this shit and she should be imprison forever.

    I love you mom and dad but I hate almost everyone else.

So basically, he felt like everyone in the world hated him for being gay and had been constantly bullied. Remove "for being gay" in that sentence, and that's the standard recipe for a school shooting massacre. Honestly, with as many gay youths that have felt so hated and hopeless that they'd decided to take their own lives, I'm surprised that no one has decided to take the lives of the hate-filled bullies on their way out.

If we don't work hard to make gay children feel safe and accepted in school, it's not a matter of if a school schooting will result, but when.
